## What is bevy-rrise?
It's a plugin for the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine that integrates the 
[Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/products/wwise) sound engine.

It relies on my [Rrise](https://github.com/dtaralla/rrise) crate for the Rust bindings of Wwise.

**PRs welcomed!**

## Usage
**First, take a look at the system requirements for [Rrise](https://github.com/dtaralla/rrise)**: they are the same 
for bevy-rrise!

Definitely take a look at the [examples](/examples) for the best way to learn how this crate works. To be able to compile and run the examples, you should generate the example Wwise project soundbanks first (located in [examples/WwiseProject](/examples/WwiseProject)).

Just add the plugin settings as resources to your Bevy app, then add the plugin itself. That's it, you can now spawn 
`RrEmitter` components, `RrEmitterBundle`s or `RrDynamicEmitterBundle`s!

```rust
fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        // Use Rrise with default settings 
        .add_plugin(RrisePlugin)
        .add_startup_system(setup_scene)
        .add_system(update)
        .run();
}

fn setup_scene(
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>,
) {
    // Load soundbank containing our PlayHelloWorld event structure and media
    if let Err(akr) = load_bank_by_name("TheBank.bnk") {
        panic!("Couldn't load TheBank: {}", akr);
    }

    // Setup mesh audio emitter
    commands
        .spawn_bundle(PbrBundle {
            mesh: meshes.add(Mesh::from(shape::Icosphere::default())),
            material: materials.add(Color::RED.into()),
            ..default()
        })
        .with_children(|parent| {
            // Attach dynamic emitter in the center of the parent
            parent.spawn_bundle(
                RrDynamicEmitterBundle::new(Vec3::default())
                    .with_event("PlayHelloWorld", true),
            );
        });

    // ... setup rest of scene
}

fn update(/* ... */) {
    // ... update scene
}
```

`RrDynamicEmitterBundle` (or `RrEmitter` components sitting on entities with a `TransformBundle`) will get their 
transform updates forwarded to Wwise automatically.

If they have a `bevy:core::Name` component, emitters will send their entity's name to Wwise for easy monitoring.

Don't hesitate to enable logging at the debug level for bevy-rrise to get an idea of what's happening under the hood!
It can also help diagnose why your sounds might not work.
